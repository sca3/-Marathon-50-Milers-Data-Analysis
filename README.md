**Marathon-50-Milers-Data-Analysis**

This project analyzes and visualizes messy marathon race data by combining data cleaning, geocoding, and business intelligence (BI) visualization. The final output is an interactive map report showing runner locations across different cities and states.

**Project Workflow**

**1. Data Cleaning**

Cleaned and transformed raw marathon race data using:

**Python (Pandas)**: handled missing values, standardized columns, created calculated fields.

**Excel**: performed quick filtering and data validation.

**MS SQL Server**: used SQL queries for deeper transformations and data integrity checks.

**2. Geocoding with Python**

Implemented a function using the **Geopy library** to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates based on runners’ city and state.

Enriched dataset with geographic coordinates for visualization purposes.

**3. Performance Analysis**

Processed and presented runner finish times.

Converted times into total race minutes for easier comparison and aggregation.

Prepared datasets to support both time-based and location-based insights.

**4. Data Visualization**

Built interactive dashboards that display:

Runner locations on a map.

Finish time and race total minutes comparisons.

Distribution of participants by city/state.

**Tools used:**

**Power BI** → interactive reports with filters for demographics & performance.

**Google Looker Studio** → shareable, web-based map reports.

**Tech Stack**

**Python → Pandas, Geopy**

**Excel**
